          <h1>To You, the one I loved the most</h1>
          <p>
            Hey there Michelle, You may not notice because I try and mask it everyday but these past months has been so depressing for me, my DMS were so dry, no one wanted to talk to me, my whole Christmas break was basically doom scrolling-sleep-repeat. It was just so damn lonely. until you were there. I didn't think much of you at first, I thought you were just a nice friend to have around, even though our conversations were a little dry at the start, I started becoming more curious, more interested and fond of you. each day I started to look forward to what we'd talk about, when I realized we had a lot of common interests I got so excited, I wanted to talk to you more, I wanted to interact with you more, I didn't realise it at first but I already took a liking of you. All I could think about is how much I wanted to talk to you, I wanted to know how your day was, I wanted to tell you how my day was, I wanted to show you things I made, I wanted to give you small gifts. I get so happy when you wave to me with such an excited face, especially when you gave me the bracelet you had, I can't lie I haven't taken it off ever since other than baths, I even  took off my other bracelets because it hid yours. After that all I could think about is what I could do to make you happy. Tbh I genuinely thought this years dinagyang was gonna the worse time for me, I was so alone, I had no one to go to concerts or people to eat with, I can't lie the first day of dinagyang was so depressing, even though I kind of forced myself into going with you, I'm glad you still went with me, as you were the only person who agreed to hang out with me, thanks to you I got to have so much fun for the last 2 days of dinagyang, because of you I was able to look forward to each day with a smile on my face, but I got attached to you too quickly, maybe it's because of my previous relationship, but I overthink way too much, my mood would get worse if you didn't talk to me. You might notice I try to get your attention, I actually just wanted to talk to you. I was so down for the past few days because I was just so scared you'll find out, I was scared to confess,  I was scared wed become awkward , I didn't want to repeat the what happend in the past 4 years, I didn't want to find another person. But I'm not scared anymore, I know it'll hurt ,I know not everything will go how I want it to be. So what will it be? Whatever it your answer is, I hope you dont choose to push me away, I'll pursue you till the ends of time(this is not a threat).
          </p>
          <p>
            (Oh and I'm so sorry I ignored you for these past days, your sister told me to never talk to you ever again, I really didn't want to but I felt like I had to... Especially since I did see you romantically and I thought it'd be bad if I kept talking to you while having these feelings since it'll go against your sisters wishes of you probably not being in a relationship or someone courting you. It genuinely killed me and I don't think I can handle more days btw so please talk to me everyday it makes me feel better, love you sssssmmmm. And I hope you can change your sister's mind. if not, nevermind everything I would have to cut contact with you.)
